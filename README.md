##⭐ About this repository

`All-Projects` is a single place that gathers my **big, standalone
projects** (not small exercises or libraries). Each project lives in its
own repository --- this repo collects links, short descriptions, and
quick open/run instructions so anyone viewing my GitHub profile can
quickly find and explore my complete project work. This repository is
maintained and will be updated whenever I publish a new project.

##📂 Projects included

> Current snapshot --- three major projects

1.  **Bank Project With (OOP)**\
    A modern, object-oriented implementation of a bank management
    system. Designed with classes for clients, accounts, transactions,
    and file-based persistence. (This is the current/main version.)

2.  **ATM Project**\
    A focused simulation of an ATM machine with authentication, balance
    inquiry, withdrawals, deposits, and transaction logging. Built to
    demonstrate user flow and secure operations.

3.  **Bank Project (old version)**\
    The legacy version of the bank project --- procedural /
    earlier-architecture implementation kept for reference and to show
    the project evolution.

##🖥️ How to open & run a project

All projects are developed and tested using **Visual Studio Community
2022**. General steps:

1.  Clone the project repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project-repo>.git
cd <project-repo>
```

2.  Open the `.sln` file with Visual Studio Community 2022 (File → Open
    → Project/Solution).

3.  Set the desired build configuration (`Debug` or `Release`) and the
    target platform (`x86` or `x64`) from the toolbar.

4.  Build the solution (`Build` → `Build Solution`) and run (`Debug` →
    `Start Debugging` or press F5).

5.  For projects that use data files (e.g., `Clients.txt`), ensure the
    data files are placed in the project working directory --- see each
    project README for specifics.
